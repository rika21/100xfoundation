        Space, also known as outer space, refers to the vast expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere where the universe
        exists. It's a near-perfect vacuum with extremely low density and pressure. Within space, celestial bodies such
        as stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and galaxies are scattered throughout. Space exploration has been a pivotal
        endeavor for humanity, leading to significant discoveries about our solar system, the cosmos, and the origins of
        the universe. Technologies like telescopes, satellites, and spacecraft enable us to study and understand the
        mysteries of space, while fostering innovations that benefit life on Earth.
